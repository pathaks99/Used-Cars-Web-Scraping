Web Scraping Used Cars listing website

About-

	In this project I have extracted data from a popular car listing website. 
	This is one of a kind ultimate web scraping project and the data extracted can be used in EDA, Prediction Models etc.

Project Highlights-

	I have used Python for coding as well as, I have worked with Selenium, Webdriver, Fake-User_Agent module, Pandas.

	The data extraction rate is above 90% .

	Obtained dataset has 50 columns & 8397 records obtained out of 9320 separate links.

	The website is Dynamically designed and has Dev-tools Bot detection, So I have designed code which will show random actions so that process doesn't get blocked.

	Code is designed to handle exceptions and overcome interruptions, except external problems like power cut-offs, internet-disconnectivity.

	Even if loop is broken, we can always resume where it is left.

Overview-

	Phase 1- Gather all Used-Cars links for different major cities and group them together for automating further process.

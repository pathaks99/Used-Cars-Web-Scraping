Web Scraping Used Cars listing website

About-

  In this project I have extracted data from a popular car listing website. 
  This is one of a kind ultimate web scraping project and the data extracted can be used in EDA, Prediction Models etc.
  
Project Highlights-

  I have used Python for coding as well as, I have worked with Selenium, Webdriver, Fake-User_Agent module, Pandas.
	
  The data extraction rate is above 90% .
	
  Obtained dataset has 50 columns & 8397 records obtained out of 9320 separate links.
	
  The website is Dynamically designed and has Dev-tools Bot detection, So I have designed code which will show random actions so that process doesn't get blocked.
	
  Code is designed to handle exceptions and overcome interruptions, except external problems like power cut-offs, internet-disconnectivity.
	
  Even if loop is broken, we can always resume where it is left.

Overview-

	Phase 1- Gather all Used-Cars links for different major cities and group them together for automating further process. 
	
	Phase 2- Loop through all car links to gather all info available (because listing page has limited info)
	
	Phase 3- Bring all data together and extract to Excel file.
